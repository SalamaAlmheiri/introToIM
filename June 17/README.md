# Production Assignment 7:
## Analog and Digital Sensors

The concept is that I used a **digital sensor** (switch) to turn on the yellow LED once and an **analog sensor** (LDR) to turn off the green LED. I am still trying to figure out how arduino works but I think I understand it better now.

Here is the Arduino [Code](https://github.com/SalamaAlmheiri/introToIM/blob/main/June%2017/Production_Assignment_7.ino)

Here is a [Video](https://github.com/SalamaAlmheiri/introToIM/blob/main/June%2017/Analog:Digital.mov)
