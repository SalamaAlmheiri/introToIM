# Production Assignment 3:
## Object Oriented Programming
This weks assignment was quite challenging. At first I could not figure out how to use the 'class' becasue I was not sure where everything would go. So I started with a simple code until it made more sense, then I used my May 31st code assignment but with 'class' fucnction with some other changes.
