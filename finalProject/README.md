# Final Project

### Concept
**Game Title: Totoro's Maze Game**
- My game is inspired by the movie "My Neighbour Totoro". There is a scene where the little girl follows the little white creature into the forest to eventually find totoro sleeping in the forest.
- So my game is based off of this forest where the player is the white creature trying to find their way to Totoro through the forest maze.
