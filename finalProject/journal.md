# First Draft Final Project Proposal

### June 29:

**Concept:**
- My idea is to create a maze game that will appear on the processing canvas and can be controlled by interacting with the arduino.
- The maze design will be inspired by the movie "My Neighbour Totoro". Where there is a scene where the little girl goes wondering into the forest to find the creature totoro sleeping. I was going to make the girl the character that moves in the maze but drawing her would be hard so i decided to draw another more simple character (which is another creature that the girl follows into the forest).



Items from **Arduino**
1. 4 buttons to move up, down, left, right
2. LED to light up when the game is won
3. LCD screen to display instructions and game comments
4. Tone: will be using the piazo buzzer for sound effects

Items from **Processing**
1. Image for the background
2. Animation for the moving object (character)
3. Text to display the instructions


Drawing that I made for the background:

### June 30:

- Today, I started working on the arduino. I made a circuit that works for the 4 buttons that I am going to use, and I wrote the aruino code.
- I also worked on Processing and drew my own sprite sheet for the character that will be moving on the screen.
- This is what it looks like:
