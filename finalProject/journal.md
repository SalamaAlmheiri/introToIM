# First Draft Final Project Proposal

### June 30:

**Concept:**
- My idea is to create a maze game that will appear on the processing canvas and can be controlled by interacting with the arduino.



Items from **Arduino**
1. 4 buttons to move up, down, left, right
2. LCD screen to display instructions and game comments
3. Tone: will be using the piazo buzzer for sound effects

Items from **Processing**
1. Image for the background
2. Animation for the moving object (character)
3. Text to display the instructions


Drawing that I made for the background:
