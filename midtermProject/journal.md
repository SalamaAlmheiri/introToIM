# Midterm Project Idea:

### June 6
Recreating the famous art piece "Girl with Balloon" by the artist Banksy on the canvas.
It will be a game where a player has to move the red balloon with the arrow keys to a higher position, as if the balloon is flying away.   

- Shape: Circle (balloon, movable). 
- Image: Upload a photo of the girl (will not be moving).  
- Sound: Success sound once the balloon is in the correct position on the canvas.   
- On-screen text: name of the game or painting.

### June 9

I changed the artwork a little bit and moved things around in order to fit the size that I want.
The moving balloon will be red while the grey balloon acts as a base where the red balloon need to reach/ be moved to in order to win the game.

### June 10

I have created a balloon class and included display and movement. For the display, it would display a ellipse which would be the "base" which the image of the red balloon would follow. In the movement section, I created a keypressed if statement so that the red balloon can be moved with the four keyboard arrows.
However, I have come across an **unknown problem** because everything is working exept that the red balloon appears in the middle of the screen but it does not move when i press the keys.
