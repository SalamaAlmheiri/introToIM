# Midterm Project Idea:

### June 6
Recreating the famous art piece "Girl with Balloon" by the artist Banksy on the canvas.
It will be a game where a player has to move the red balloon with the arrow keys to a higher position, as if the balloon is flying away.   

- Shape: Circle (balloon, movable). 
- Image: Upload a photo of the girl (will not be moving).  
- Sound: Success sound once the balloon is in the correct position on the canvas.   
- On-screen text: name of the game or painting.

### June 9

I changed the artwork a little bit and moved things around in order to fit the size that I want.
The grey balloon is the area where the moving balloon has to reach/ be moved to. The moving balloon will be red.
