# Midterm Project Idea:

Recreating the famous art piece "Girl with Balloon" by the artist Banksy on the canvas.
It will be a game where a player has to move the red balloon with the arrow keys to a higher position, as if the balloon is flying away.   

- Shape: Circle (balloon, movable). 
- Image: Upload a photo of the girl (will not be moving).  
- Sound: Success sound once the balloon is in the correct position on the canvas.   
- On-screen text: name of the game or painting.
