# Production Assignment 9 :
## Game (communication between Arduino and Processing): 


Concept:
- This will be a drawing game.
- By twisting the potentiometer, the "player" will be able to draw on the screen just like the concept of the toy "etch a sketch".
- However, the problem is I only have one potentiometer, but the toy uses two to be able to move in both directions and up and down.
- Therefore, I will be using a potentiometer to move up and down and 2 buttons, 1 to move right, the other left.
