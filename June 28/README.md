# Production Assignment 9 :
## Game (communication between Arduino and Processing): 

# [In Progress]

Concept:
- This will be a drawing game.
- By twisting the potentiometer, the "player" will be able to draw on the screen just like the concept of the toy "etch a sketch".
- However, the problem is I only have one potentiometer, but the toy uses two to be able to move in both directions and up and down.
