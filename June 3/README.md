# Production Assignment 4
### Art with Transformations and Classes

Concept: The concept of this code is to generate random (rectangle) shapes with different colors and see what type of abstract looking art it could create. 


The problem with this code is that the upper part of the canvas was not being covered with the rectangles and I was unnable to figure out what the problem was.
