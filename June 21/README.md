# Production Assignment 8:
## Musical instrument

Concept:
- To turn on the sound and sensor when the button is pressed. Frequency will change when i move my hand to block the light from the light sensor.
- music will play with moving your hand on the sensor.
- I am having trouble making the sensor work. You can see from the video that the sound is working but the frequency does not change when i move my hand. There might be a mistake in the code that I have to make some changes but I am still not sure what it is.



Here is the Arduino [Code](https://github.com/SalamaAlmheiri/introToIM/blob/main/June%2021/Production_Assignment_music_8_V2.ino)
