# Production Assignment 8:
## Musical instrument

Concept:
- To turn on the music and sensor when the button is pressed. The music will play with moving your hand on the sensor.
- I am having trouble making the circuit work. It was making music yesterday but when i tried to connect it again today it is not working.

**[In Progress]**

Here is the Arduino [Code](https://github.com/SalamaAlmheiri/introToIM/blob/main/June%2021/Production_Assignment__music_8_V1.ino)
